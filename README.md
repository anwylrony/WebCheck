## ✨ Features

The scanner performs a wide range of checks to identify security weaknesses:

### 🎯 Vulnerability Detection
* **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Detects error-based and basic SQL injection vulnerabilities via URL parameters and forms.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Checks for reflected XSS in parameters and form inputs.
* **Directory Traversal (LFI):** Tests for Local File Inclusion using various encoding bypass techniques.
* **Open Redirect:** Identifies URL redirection vulnerabilities that could facilitate phishing.
* **Sensitive File Exposure:** Scans for exposed configuration files (`.env`, `.git`, `web.config`), backups, and logs.

### 🔒 Configuration & Headers
* **Security Headers Analysis:** Checks for missing headers (`CSP`, `X-Frame-Options`, `HSTS`, etc.).
* **SSL/TLS Analysis:** Validates certificate expiration, weak protocols (TLS 1.0/1.1), and weak signature algorithms.
* **CORS Misconfiguration:** Tests for overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies.
* **Clickjacking:** Checks if the site can be framed by external domains.
* **Cookie Security:** Analyzes cookies for missing `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes.

### 📊 Reporting
* **Interactive HTML Reports:** Generates a modern, dark-themed dashboard with :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} visualizations.
* **JSON Reports:** Structured data output for integration with other tools.
* **Risk Scoring:** Calculates a risk score based on the severity of findings.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.6 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vapt-scanner.git
   cd vapt-scanner
````

2. **Install dependencies**
   Create a `requirements.txt` file (see below) or install directly:

   ```bash
   pip install requests urllib3
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### Basic Scan

To run a scan against a target URL:

```bash
python vapt_scanner.py https://example.com
```

### Advanced Options

| Argument       | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`          | The target URL to scan (required).                             |
| `--timeout`    | Request timeout in seconds (default: 10).                      |
| `--proxy`      | Proxy URL for routing traffic (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080`). |
| `--user-agent` | Custom User-Agent string for requests.                         |

### Examples

**Using a Proxy (Burp Suite / ZAP):**

Burp Suite is developed by PortSwigger and ZAP is maintained by OWASP.

```bash
python vapt_scanner.py https://example.com --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Custom Timeout and User-Agent:**

```bash
python vapt_scanner.py https://example.com --timeout 15 --user-agent "Googlebot"
```

---

## 📁 Output

Upon completion, the scanner saves the results in the current directory with filenames based on the target domain and timestamp.

1. **HTML Report (`*_vapt_*.html`)**

   * A visually appealing, responsive dashboard.
   * Includes severity distribution pie charts and category breakdown bar charts.
   * Expandable rows for detailed vulnerability descriptions and remediation advice.

2. **JSON Report (`*_vapt_*.json`)**

   * Structured raw data suitable for CI/CD pipelines or further programmatic analysis.

## 📋 Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```text
requests>=2.25.0
urllib3>=1.26.0
```

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Reconnaissance** – Extracts forms and parses URL parameters from the target page.
2. **Payload Injection** – Iterates through extensive payload lists for SQLi, XSS, and traversal testing.
3. **Analysis** – Analyzes HTTP responses for error patterns, reflection, and security misconfigurations.
4. **Multithreading** – Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for efficient sensitive file detection.
5. **Reporting** – Aggregates findings, calculates a risk score, and generates dual-format reports.
